                        <p>A photographic studio (also known as a photography studio or photo studio) is a workspace to take,
                        develop, print and duplicate photographs. Photographic training and the display of finished photographs
                        may also be accommodated in a photographic studio. The studio may have a darkroom, storage space, a studio
                        proper where photographs are taken, a display room and space for other related work. A photographic studio
                        is often a business owned and represented by one or more photographers, possibly accompanied by assistants and
                        pupils, who create and sell their own and sometimes othersâ€™ photographs.</p>
                        <p>The first commercial use of photography was in the production of portraits. Photography replaced painting
                        completely by 40s. with fully equipped studios in existence. The photography process was much shorter and simple
                        as compared to painting, in which the subject and even the painter used to suffer. 'Calotypes' was introduced in
                        1840s. With the introduction of calotypes the production of negative enabled the photographers to print as many
                        copies as customer required, hence strengthening the very base for the studios.</p>
